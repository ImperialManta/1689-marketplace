## About

**Xubao Marketplace** is a decentralized trading platform designed for online game players.

Traditional virtual item trading is full of scam risks — buyers pay and sellers disappear, or sellers deliver and buyers refuse to pay. Xubao Marketplace solves this with **BNB Smart Chain smart contracts**: funds are automatically held in escrow by the blockchain contract and only released upon trade completion, protecting both parties.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔒 Smart Contract Escrow
Once a buyer confirms a purchase, USDT is automatically locked in the smart contract. Funds are only released after the buyer confirms in-game delivery. **No need to trust the other party — or the platform.**

### ⚡ Fully Transparent On-Chain
Every transaction is permanently recorded on BNB Smart Chain. Anyone can verify trades on [BscScan](https://bscscan.com) — immutable and tamper-proof.

### 🛡️ Dispute Resolution
If a dispute arises (e.g. seller fails to deliver), the buyer can file a dispute. The platform admin investigates and the ruling is enforced directly through the contract — fair and final.

### 🌍 Bilingual Interface (中文 / English)
Switch languages with one click, serving both Taiwanese and international players.

### 💻 No Installation Required
All operations are done through a desktop browser with MetaMask — no app download needed.

## 💱 Trading Flow

```
1. Seller lists an item (game, server, type, price, contact info)
        ↓
2. Buyer browses listings, enters in-game character name, and clicks "Buy"
        ↓
3. USDT is automatically locked in the smart contract escrow
        ↓
4. Seller contacts the buyer and delivers the virtual item in-game
        ↓
5. Buyer confirms receipt by clicking "Confirm Delivery"
        ↓
6. Contract automatically releases payment to the seller (minus 3% platform fee) ✓
```

**Other scenarios:**
- Buyer wants to cancel → Cancel the order, USDT is fully refunded (5-minute cooldown before re-purchasing the same listing)
- No confirmation after 24 hours → Seller can claim a timeout release
- Dispute arises → File a dispute; admin adjudicates (10% arbitration fee charged to the losing party)
